Individuals are able to travel to workplaces, shopping, educational institutions, recreation, medical care, and other locations critical to their quality of life. The changes brought about by technology and especially the smartphone revolution with its impacts on online shopping and the emergence of transportation network companies have upended the way people live, work, shop, and play with profound implications for transportation investment, policy, and operational decisions. One example of this change is the decrease in the proportion of licensed drivers among the 55 and under age cohorts in 2014 compared to 19831F . These changes in travel behavior need to be measured accurately to ensure that policy decisions happen in a data driven context. Collecting data on travel behavior is also becoming more challenging and is hampered by low survey response rates or high rates of survey attrition. Therefore, it is critical to quilt different sources of travel behavior data to provide estimates in a consistent, reliable, and sustainable manner. The FHWA report on data availability and gaps related to our understanding of travel behavior highlights the need for data fusion techniques to overcome these gaps2F . Census data, even in this age of big data, offer tremendous value and insights to help overcome the data availability and gaps identified by FHWA. The various data products released by the Census Bureau and its extensions provide information and insights that will help arrive at data driven policy decisions to address these changes. 1.1 History of the Census The Census is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution as stated in Article I, Section 2, clause 3: For a government of the people to function, the people must be counted. The Founders wanted an enumeration to occur within three years of the first meeting of Congress, and then within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. On March 1, 1790, President George Washington signed legislation into lawthe 1790 Census Actassigning U.S. marshals the task of conducting the nations first Census. Marshals and their assistants traveled throughout the 13 states, districts of Kentucky, Maine, Vermont, and the Southwest Territory (Tennessee) using rudimentary forms of their own design to collect the name of each head of household along with a numeric count of every households free White males aged 16 and older, free White males under 16, free White females, all other free persons, and slaves as of the first Monday of August 1790. At its conclusion, the 1790 Census found that the United States was home to 3,929,214 people. The largest urban places were New York City, NY (33,131 residents); Philadelphia, PA (28,522); Boston, MA (18,320); and Baltimore, MD (13,503). Twenty years later, Congress added the collection of manufacturing data to the 1810 Census. The Census expanded further with the first questions about the nations agricultural pursuits in 1820. In 1840, Congress added the collection of governments data about schools and school attendance. Beginning in 1850, marshals listed the name of every free person on the Census schedule, and the number of demographic inquiries grew to include questions to collect data about individuals profession, place of birth, and marital status. The Census Act of 1880 replaced the U.S. marshals and their assistantswho conducted the Censuses since 1790with specially-hired and trained enumerators. These Census enumerators collected so much data during the 1880 Census that it took a decade to complete its tabulation and publication. Anticipating an even greater volume of data in 1890, former Census Bureau employee and inventor Herman Hollerith received a contract to supply mechanical tabulators to speed data processing and tabulation. Enumerators used a separate schedule for each family during the 1890 Census and collected even more detailed data about individuals family, employment, health, education, and home ownership than in previous years. One hundred years after the United States conducted its first Census, the 1890 Census reported the nation had grown to nearly 63 million. Recognizing the need to maintain a permanent, specially-trained workforce charged with collecting the nations demographic, economic, agriculture and governments data, Congress made the U.S. Census Bureau a permanent agency in 1902. The Census Bureau could now plan population Censuses every 10 years as well as mid-decade Censuses and surveys, including more frequent Censuses of manufacturers and special Censuses of war commodities during World War I. Following the 1929 Stock Market Crash and the start of the Great Depression, the 1930 Census included a standard questionnaire that collected demographic, citizenship, occupation, employment, and veterans status data. A supplemental questionnaire also collected additional data to help the government better understand the impact that the economic crisis had on Americas workers. The 1940 Census was the first in which the Census Bureau used statistical sampling to collect additional data about the population without unduly increasing the overall burden on respondents and data processing. While visiting each household, the enumerators asked 5 percent of the nations population (i.e., those people whose name fell on the schedules sample lines) questions like their parents place of birth, mother tongue, veterans status, and for women, the number of marriages, age at first marriage, and number of children ever born. Subsequent Censuses added sample questions including the means of transportation to work (1960), occupation 5 years ago (1970), ancestry/ethnic origin (1980), and grandparents as caregivers (2000). In 2005, the annual American Community Survey replaced the sample questions on the decennial Census questionnaires. As a result, the 2010 Census used a single, 10-question form for the nearly 309 million people it counted. Over its 230 year history, the decennial Census has recorded the United States remarkable growth from its origins as a rural, farming nation in 1790 to the worlds third most populous country (behind China and India), which provided goods and services valued at $21.73 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Figure 1.1 shows a timeline of the Census since 1790. Figure 1.1: Census Timeline since 1790 Source: U.S. Census Bureau 1.2 History of Transportation in the Census The inclusion of transportation items is a fairly recent occurrence in the history of the decennial Census. Questions pertaining to transportation did not appear until 1960 when three such questions were asked on a 25-percent sample basis. The population items in 1960 included questions on each workers place of work (city, county, and state) and means of transportation to work. The housing items included a question on the number of automobiles available for use by the members of each household. The principal impetus for adding the question on place of work to the 1960 Census was the need for data on commuting interchanges for use as an indicator of economic integration between large cities and their suburbs as part of the criteria for delineating metropolitan statistical areas. The commuting data from the Census were certainly of interest to transportation planners, but urban transportation planning in the early 1960s was still being done on the basis of locally conducted origin-destination surveys (See Figure 1.2) Figure 1.2: 1960 Census Transportation Questions Source: https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1960censusquestionnaire-2.pdf. By 1970, with the development by the Census Bureau of Address Coding Guides (ACGs) and Dual Independent Map Encoding (DIME) files, interest in the Census as a source of transportation planning data increased considerably. The ACGs and DIME files provided the capability of geographically coding place-of-work addresses within the urbanized portion of metropolitan areas down to the level of the Census block. The 1970 Census again asked questions on place of work, means of transportation to work, and automobile availability. However, the place-of-work question asked for the actual street address of the respondents workplace, and these addresses were coded to Census blocks within the areas covered by ACGs and DIME files. The DOT contracted with the Bureau of the Census to create a series of special tabulations in a transportation planning package. Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) obtained the data tabulated for their traffic zones on a cost-reimbursable basis. Between 1970 and 1980, several developments resulted in a significant expansion in the number of transportation items included in the decennial Census. The energy crisis of the early 1970s and the subsequent ongoing concern for the nations supply of nonrenewable energy sources brought about a sharp increase in the need for statistics for transportation planning and policy formulation. From 1975 to 1977, under the sponsorship of the DOT, the Census Bureau conducted for the first time journey-to-work surveys in 60 metropolitan areas and a national survey in 1975, all as part of the Annual Housing Survey. In recognition of the growing need for analysis of these data, a Journey-to-Work Statistics Branch was created within the bureaus Population Division to carry out the technical planning and developmental work pertaining to the collection, processing, tabulation, and analysis of journey-to-work data from the decennial Census and periodic surveys. Also, during the decade, the cost of conducting metropolitan origin-destination surveys increased rapidly, and the DOT began to encourage local agencies to look to the decennial Census as an alternative source for cost effective transportation planning data. Thus, due to the significant increase in the need for transportation data at all levels of government, the 1980 Census included eight transportation items: six population questions and two housing questions. On the population side, in addition to questions on place of work and means of transportation to work, the 1980 Census asked about carpooling arrangements, the number of riders in the carpool, travel time from home to work, and whether persons had a disability that limited or prevented their use of public transportation. On the housing side, the automobile availability question was supplemented with an additional question on the number of light trucks and vans available for use by members of each household. Once again for the 1980 Census, the DOT contracted with the Census Bureau to create a series of special tabulations in a Transportation Planning Package. MPOs obtained the data tabulated for their traffic analysis zones on a cost-reimbursable basis. To increase the utility of the Census data for local transportation planning, the Census Bureau developed an innovative procedure to assign incomplete place-of-work responses to Census blocks so that they too could be tabulated at the traffic analysis zone level (See Figure 1.3). Figure 1.3: 1980 Census Transportation Questions Source: https://www.Census.gov/history/pdf/1980_long_questionnaire.pdf In contrast to the 1980 Census, the 1990 decennial Census did not break up the household vehicle availability question into two separate questions but rather treated it as a single question and included information about travel mode, work location, carpool as well as two new questions on departure time to work and travel time to work. The 2000 decennial Census, the last year of the long form, had the same transportation related questions as the 1990 decennial Census which were asked of one in six households. Since 2000, the long form is no longer available and transportation related questions are being asked by the American Community Survey (ACS) which samples one in forty households on a rolling basis. "],["census-transportation-planning-products.html", "Chapter 2 Census Transportation Planning Products 2.1 History of the CTPP", " Chapter 2 Census Transportation Planning Products The CTPP is an American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) sponsored Technical Services Program funded by member state transportation agencies and operates with support from FHWA, OST-R, FTA, Census Bureau, MPOs and TRB. The program includes data products; training and technical assistance; and research and outreach. The program is designed for the transportation community by the transportation community and is guided by an oversight board composed of MPOs and DOT representatives from across the United States. The CTPP uses data from the ACS and releases products based on the 5-year ACS. The CTPP summarizes data by place of residence, place of work, and flows from home to work. The data are available in both Census geography as well as custom geographies such as Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) and Traffic Analysis Districts (TAD) and are available for unique universes such as workers in households. The CTPP is built as a special tabulation by the Census Bureau for the transportation community. 2.1 History of the CTPP The availability of block-level data on commuting origins and destinations from the 1970 Census made possible the development for the first time of the Urban Transportation Planning Package (UTPP)15F . The 1970 UTPP was a special tabulation of Census data for individual metropolitan areas tailored to the geographic areas that are used in transportation planning. Local transportation planning organizations prepared specifications for the blocks that made up their traffic analysis zones, and the Census Bureau then produced a standard set of tabulations for those zones on a cost-reimbursable basis. Specifications for the content of the UTPP were submitted to the Bureau by FHWA. About 120 UTPPs were prepared using the 1970 Census. The Census Bureau again produced the UTPP after the 1980 Census. This time specifications were developed and submitted to the Bureau by an ad hoc committee of transportation planners under the auspices of TRB. Funding for development of the necessary computer programs and administration of the 1980 project was provided by the DOT. The number of packages produced increased to over 150. Significant innovations in the dissemination of the journey-to-work data were achieved for the 1990 Census. Two transportation planning packages were produced: statewide packages for each state and the District of Columbia and urban packages for the transportation study area defined by each MPO. Production of the transportation planning packages by the Census Bureau was sponsored by the state departments of transportation under a pooled funding arrangement with AASHTO. This pooled funding arrangement supported the production of data for the entire country instead of only those areas that decided to purchase the data as in previous Censuses. The number of packages produced (both state and metropolitan) increased to 415 for the 1990 Census. The 1990 CTPP continued the program established in 1970 and conducted in 1980 in the same general format. A working group was established to develop the specifications for the 1990 CTPP for both the metropolitan data set and the statewide data set. This ad hoc group consisted of members from AASHTO, the National Association of Regional Councils, FHWA, FTA, the Census Bureau, plus experts in the field from states and MPOs. A similar group had developed the 1980 UTPP. The statewide tabulations were the first product produced from the 1990 CTPP. A file was produced for each state, containing data for the households, persons, and workers who live in each city and county in the state, data on all workers working in each city and county in the state, and data on commuter flows between counties and cities. The urban tabulations were similar to the data provided in the statewide package, except that the data were tabulated on the basis of Census tracts or traffic analysis zones. The urban data were delivered after the delivery of the statewide packages. An urban package was produced for each metropolitan area for which the Census Bureau had an address coding capability. The main focus of the 2000 CTPP16F program was to improve access to the data for a wide range of participants in the program, and to take advantage of more modern data processing and analysis technologies. The first step in this process was to contract with two companies to create software to accompany the distribution of the 2000 CTPP data on CD. More modern methods were also provided for agencies to create their TAZ equivalency files and for examining and updating the Workplace Files (Major Employer Lists) used in Place-of-Work coding. FHWA, along with the Census Bureaus geography division, sponsored an ArcView application using TIGER-Line files which CTPP 2000 customers used to define Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ-UP). The Journey to Work (JTW) Branch contracted with ESRI to create an ArcView application called the Workplace Update Extension (WorkUP). This was a tool that MPOs could use to verify, correct, and add entries for employers in their area to ensure more accurate and complete workplace data. An extended Place-of-Work allocation system was also developed and implemented in the 2000 Census. Extended allocation went beyond that used in the main Census and resulted in a greater number of records containing codes all the way down to the block level. 2.1.1 Dancing with the DRB Following the transition to the ACS, there were a series of changes that impacted the CTPP due to the smaller sample size in the ACS compared to the long form that was prevalent till 2000. In 2008, the Census Disclosure Review Board (DRB) reviewed the first ACS based CTPP product which was limited to the 3-year ACS data. The DRB handed down the following ruling: The data will be rounded as all ACS special tabulations. DRB rules for means, medians and other quantiles will be applied. For all tables where means of transportation is shown but not crossed with any other variable, there is no threshold on the means of transportation categories. For all tables where means of transportation is shown and crossed with one or more other variables, there must be at least 3 unweighted cases for each category of means of transportation in a given geographic area to be shown. Categories and/or geographic areas should be collapsed to meet this threshold. For all flow tables, there must be at least 3 unweighted cases per pair of geographic areas with the exception of Total workers univariate and Means of Transportation univariate (no required threshold). This ruling by the DRB led to AASHTO Standing committee on Planning (SCOP) approving funding for NCHRP 08-79: Producing Transportation Data Products from the ACS that Comply with Disclosure Rules and published as NCHRP web only report 18018F . This led to publication of disclosure proofed tables that shown in Figure 2.1. Disclosure Proofing is a statistical process known as perturbation that was applied to the ACS data to assure that an individual could not be identified. The process has been well vetted in the transportation and statistical communities and has been well accepted. Figure 2.1: Disclosure Rules for CTPP Tables Based on the Five-Year ACS Source: NCHRP Web Document 180  Producing Transportation Data Products from the American Community Survey That Comply with Disclosure Rules Even after meeting all the requirements of the DRB for the 2006  2010 CTPP, the Census Bureau asked the CTPP Oversight Board to reduce the proposed 2012 - 2016 tabulation by 2/3 and to reduce the number of tables produced at all geographies. Using a combination of table usage and subject matter expert insights, for the 2012 - 2016 CTPP, the number of tables available for public release were decreased by 176. These changes by parts 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2: Changes between 2006  2010 CTPP and 2012  2016 CTPP source: http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conferences/2017/CensusData/FaellaNewData.pdf. As stated previously, the CTPP produces commute characteristics for the population broken across different universes: All Persons; All Workers; Persons in Household; and Workers in Households; Workers not working at home. For these different universes, commute characteristics as well as flow characteristics are available by various socioeconomic characteristics and commute mode. The complete list of tables and the associated geographies is available at the CTPP website "],["ctpp-case-studies.html", "Chapter 3 CTPP Case Studies 3.1 Case Study 1 - Understand Nationwide Demographic Trends 3.2 Case Study 2 - Statewide Snapshot of Mean Travel Times 3.3 Case Study 3 - Travel Demand Model Calibration 3.4 Resources", " Chapter 3 CTPP Case Studies This chapter provides a series of case studies for using the CTPP data for various analytical purposes. The code presented here are for illustrative purposes and it is the hope that analysts using this field guide will be able to take the code and manipulate it for their own needs. 3.1 Case Study 1 - Understand Nationwide Demographic Trends Scenario: Emily Planner is a GS5 who has recently joined FHWAs Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty (HEP). On the first week of her job, her supervisor comes to her and tells her that HEP is working to gather data to address historical inequities. Her supervisor asks her asks her that as part of the administrations initiative to address historical inequities, can she gather information about demographic trends in the nation. Also, while she is pulling up this data, can she also create a handy visual that provides decision makers with a snapshot of these trends at a macro level. After her supervisor hands over this assignment, Emily, having attended training offered by AASHTO, recalls that the CTPP has this information available in a handy manner and she can download the data quickly and develop the desired visual. 3.1.1 Analysis Steps for Case Study 1 The first thing that Emily does is head over to the CTPP website and gets to the CTPP data (Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2). Figure 3.1: CTPP Website Figure 3.2: CTPP Data Access Knowing that she might be asked to retrieve this and other information on regular basis, Emily decides to create an account on the CTPP page to store her data calls and have it available on a regular basis (Figure 3.3) Figure 3.3: CTPP Login Details She then selects the 20122016 Part 1  Residence tables and from this list selects table A101201  Age (11) by Minority Status (3) (All Persons). She notes that this information is available only at large geographies (the data is available only at the State, County, MCD, Place, PUMA/POWPUMA, MSA levels). This level of geography was sufficient for the purposes of her analysis and she decides that this is the table she will use for her analysis (Figure 3.4) and proceeds to download it as a CSV file (Figure 3.5) Figure 3.4: Select Relevant CTPP Table Figure 3.5: Download Relevant CTPP Table The resulting dataset is show in Figure 3.6 Figure 3.6: Table A101201 Having downloaded the dataset, Emily proceeds to create the visual requested by her supervisor. She decides that a population pyramid for all states would be a handy visual for decision makers to have at their finger tips. To create this visual Emily undertakes the following steps. The data downloaded from the CTPP website does not have Census georeferences handy therefore Emily decides to map the GEOID to the data table downloaded from the CTPP site. #Load Libraries library(data.table) library(tidyverse) library(geofacet) ## Use data.table library to read the input file and merge it with GEOID file ## First read the data from the CSV downloaded in the previous step A101201 &lt;- fread(&quot;data/A101201.csv&quot;,header=TRUE,sep=&quot;,&quot;) ## Next read in the state file and set it as a data.table object (setDT command) stategeo &lt;- setDT(readRDS(&quot;data/state_geoids.RDS&quot;)) ## Merge the two files # Sort by NAME setkey(A101201,NAME) setkey(stategeo,NAME) # Now merge the files A101201A &lt;- stategeo[A101201] # View the resulting data frame tibble(A101201A) #&gt; # A tibble: 3,378 x 6 #&gt; GEOID NAME Age Minority Output Population #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 01 Alaba~ Total, a~ Total persons Estimate 4841165 #&gt; 2 01 Alaba~ Total, a~ White alone, ~ Estimate 3204335 #&gt; 3 01 Alaba~ Total, a~ White alone, ~ Margin ~ 642 #&gt; 4 01 Alaba~ Total, a~ Other Estimate 1636830 #&gt; 5 01 Alaba~ Total, a~ Other Margin ~ 642 #&gt; 6 01 Alaba~ Age 0 to~ Total persons Estimate 976860 #&gt; 7 01 Alaba~ Age 0 to~ Total persons Margin ~ 1377 #&gt; 8 01 Alaba~ Age 0 to~ White alone, ~ Estimate 570015 #&gt; 9 01 Alaba~ Age 0 to~ White alone, ~ Margin ~ 1114 #&gt; 10 01 Alaba~ Age 0 to~ Other Estimate 406845 #&gt; # ... with 3,368 more rows Emily then cleans up the resulting dataset and creates the Population Structure by Age and Minority Status by state (Figure 3.7) # Cleanup the dataset A101201B &lt;- A101201A %&gt;% filter(str_detect(Age, &quot;^Age&quot;), # Selects rows that starts with Age in the Age Column Output != &quot;Margin of Error&quot;, Minority !=&quot;Total persons&quot;) %&gt;% #Deletes rows where Output=Margin of Error and Minority = Total Persons group_by(NAME) %&gt;% #groups by state mutate(prop = Population / sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% # Calculate percentage by Race ungroup() %&gt;% mutate(prop = ifelse(Minority == &quot;White alone, not Hispanic/Latino&quot;, -prop, prop)) # Setup data for mapping ggplot(A101201B, aes(x = prop, y = Age, fill = Minority)) + geom_col(width = 1) + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;darkred&quot;, &quot;navy&quot;)) + facet_geo(~NAME, grid = &quot;us_state_with_DC_PR_grid2&quot;, label = &quot;code&quot;) + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8)) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;, title = &quot;Population structure by Age and Minority Status&quot;, fill = &quot;&quot;, caption = &quot;Data source: 2012-2016 CTPP Table A101201&quot;) Figure 3.7: Population Structure by Age and Minority Status 3.2 Case Study 2 - Statewide Snapshot of Mean Travel Times Scenario: Jenny Modeler is a member of the Forecasting and Trends Office at the Florida DOT and they have been requested by their supervisor to provide a county level estimate of average travel times for commuters. 3.2.1 Analysis Steps for Case Study 2 Jenny heads to the CTPP site, and they create a new selection set showing only Florida counties and download table B106202  Mean Travel time (1) by Means of transportation (18) (Workers 16 years and over who did not work at home).
