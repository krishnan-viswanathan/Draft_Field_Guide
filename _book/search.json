Marshals assistants traveled throughout 13 states, districts Kentucky, Maine, Vermont, Southwest Territory (Tennessee) using rudimentary forms design collect name head household along numeric count every household’s free White males aged 16 older, free White males 16, free White females, free persons, slaves first Monday August 1790. conclusion, 1790 Census found United States home 3,929,214 people. largest urban places New York City, NY (33,131 residents); Philadelphia, PA (28,522); Boston, MA (18,320); Baltimore, MD (13,503).Twenty years later, Congress added collection manufacturing data 1810 Census. Census expanded first questions nation’s agricultural pursuits 1820. 1840, Congress added collection governments’ data schools school attendance. Beginning 1850, marshals listed name every free person Census schedule, number demographic inquiries grew include questions collect data individuals’ profession, place birth, marital status.Census Act 1880 replaced U.S. marshals assistants—conducted Censuses since 1790—specially-hired trained enumerators. Census enumerators collected much data 1880 Census took decade complete tabulation publication. Anticipating even greater volume data 1890, former Census Bureau employee inventor Herman Hollerith received contract supply mechanical tabulators speed data processing tabulation. Enumerators used separate schedule family 1890 Census collected even detailed data individuals’ family, employment, health, education, home ownership previous years. One hundred years United States conducted first Census, 1890 Census reported nation grown nearly 63 million.\nRecognizing need maintain permanent, specially-trained workforce charged collecting nation’s demographic, economic, agriculture governments data, Congress made U.S. Census Bureau permanent agency 1902. Census Bureau now plan population Censuses every 10 years well mid-decade Censuses surveys, including frequent Censuses manufacturers special Censuses war commodities World War .Following 1929 Stock Market Crash start Great Depression, 1930 Census included “standard” questionnaire collected demographic, citizenship, occupation, employment, veterans status data. supplemental questionnaire also collected additional data help government better understand impact economic crisis America’s workers. 1940 Census first Census Bureau used statistical sampling collect additional data population without unduly increasing overall burden respondents data processing. visiting household, enumerators asked 5 percent nation’s population (.e., people whose name fell schedule’s “sample lines”) questions like parents’ place birth, mother tongue, veterans status, women, number marriages, age first marriage, number children ever born. Subsequent Censuses added sample questions including means transportation work (1960), occupation 5 years ago (1970), ancestry/ethnic origin (1980), grandparents caregivers (2000). 2005, annual American Community Survey replaced sample questions decennial Census questionnaires. result, 2010 Census used single, 10-question form nearly 309 million people counted.230 year history, decennial Census recorded United States’ remarkable growth origins rural, farming nation 1790 world’s third populous country (behind China India), provided goods services valued $21.73 trillion fourth quarter 2019.
